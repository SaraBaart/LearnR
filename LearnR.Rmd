```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Packages

For a lot of R functions, additional libraries need to be loaded.

This can be done with:

```{r echo = T, eval=FALSE}
library(lattice)
```

Sometimes the library needs to be installed first:

```{r echo = T, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(lattice)
library(lattice)
```

*Installing* a library only needs to be done once. *Loading* the library must be done every time you start R. 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document3. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
